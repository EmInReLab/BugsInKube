  "description": "When the update strategy for a DaemonSet in Kubernetes is set to RollingUpdate and maxSurge is greater than 1, If a Node's status is under pressure, the system repeatedly creates and then evicts Pods. This behavior creates a lot of unnecessary churn and could potentially cause problems with system resources.",
  "expected-behaviour": "When the update strategy for a DaemonSet in Kubernetes is set to RollingUpdate and maxSurge is greater than 1, it should show like the behavior when option maxSurge is 0."
