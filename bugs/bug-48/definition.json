  "description": "Migrating from client-side apply to server-side apply leaves the objects in a somewhat corrupted state, and result in the resources forever being inconsistent with their expected state.",
  "expected-behaviour": "If apply a manifest using client-side apply and then switch to server-side apply with no changes, the operation succeeds. However, if then delete a field from the manifest and run server-side apply again, the field stays in the resource instead of being removed"
