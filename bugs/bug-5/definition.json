  "description": "When you use a patch to change a pod's CPU or memory limits, the new limit can only be increased. Decreasing the limit through a patch doesn't enforce the lower value and the pod can continue using resources up to the previous limit.",
  "expected-behaviour": "When you reduce a pod's CPU or memory limit using a patch, the expectation is for Kubernetes to throttle the pod's resource usage to stay below the new, lower limit."
